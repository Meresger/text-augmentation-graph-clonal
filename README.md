### TextAugmentation-CLONALG-AMR
Welcome to the TextAugmentation-CLONALG-AMR repository! This repository showcases a graph-based approach and the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG) for text augmentation in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

## Overview
Annotated data plays a crucial role in training machine learning models. However, manually labeling large amounts of data with high-quality annotations can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. In the field of NLP, the labels provided by human annotators vary in competency, training, and experience, leading to arbitrary and ambiguous standards. To address the challenges of insufficient high-quality labels, researchers have been exploring automated methods for enhancing training and testing datasets.

In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG) and abstract meaning representation (AMR) graphs to improve the quality and quantity of data in two cybersecurity problems: fake news identification and sensitive data leak detection. Our proposed approach demonstrates significant enhancements in dataset performance and classification accuracy, surpassing baseline results by at least 5%.
